<task_description>## Task
Answer natural language questions about business transactions and vendor relationships by analyzing a knowledge graph. This requires BOTH explicit information retrieval AND implicit pattern inference from the graph structure and data.

## Critical Instruction: Inference is Required
Many questions cannot be answered by simple lookup - you must:
- **Infer patterns from multiple data points** (e.g., "payment discrepancies" means finding varying amounts across transactions to the same vendor, NOT looking for explicit "discrepancy" nodes)
- **Analyze trends across entities** (e.g., "consistently give discounts" means checking multiple transactions, not finding a "consistent_discount" flag)
- **Detect implicit issues** from data patterns (e.g., different amounts on similar transactions suggest potential discrepancies)
- **Make reasonable deductions** from available data (e.g., if you see vendor transactions but no payment records, you can infer payment status is unknown)

Do NOT say "the graph contains no information about X" if X can be inferred from patterns in the data.

## Question Types and How to Answer Them

### 1. Verification Questions
**Pattern**: "Can you check...", "Can you confirm...", "verify whether..."
**Approach**:
- Search for relevant transaction/payment nodes
- If found: Report what exists with specific IDs and amounts
- If incomplete: Explicitly state what's missing ("no payment record", "no invoice", etc.)
- Never claim information doesn't exist if you can infer or partially answer

**Example Question**: "Can you check whether all payments to Vendor 2 are correct?"
**Good Answer**: "Found one payment to Vendor 2: tx-v2-m02-176206 (recorded 2025-03-04) - total 3723.76, discount 460.24. No other payments to Vendor 2 appear in the provided data. I can't confirm whether it's wrong without the expected invoice/amount or bank remittance."
**Bad Answer**: "The graph doesn't contain correctness information for payments."

### 2. Lookup Questions
**Pattern**: "Did we buy...", "Have we paid...", "Do we have..."
**Approach**:
- Search nodes for matching products, vendors, or transaction types
- Report positive findings with full details (transaction IDs, dates, amounts, SKUs, quantities)
- For negative findings: State clearly that nothing matches

**Example Question**: "Have we paid for any storage devices or hard drives recently?"
**Good Answer**: "Yes. 2025-03-04 purchase TX-V2-M02-176206 included 5× Western Digital 2TB HDD (SKU DHP-HDD-002), line total $445. Also invoice inv-v17-m04-570345 (dated 2025-05-10) includes 9× WD Blue 1TB SSD (SKU DC-SSD-017), line total $981."
**Bad Answer**: "The graph contains transaction records."

### 3. Comparison Questions
**Pattern**: "Do we spend more with X or Y", "typically", "usually", "compared to"
**Approach**:
- Aggregate relevant values across all matching transactions
- Compute totals or identify patterns
- Provide clear comparison with numbers

**Example Question**: "Do we spend more with Vendor 4 or Vendor 2?"
**Good Answer**: "We spend more with Vendor 4 - $17,161.20 (Vendor 4) vs $3,723.76 (Vendor 2)."
**Bad Answer**: "Both vendors have transactions in the graph."

### 4. Analysis Questions (REQUIRES PATTERN INFERENCE)
**Pattern**: "Which vendors consistently...", "Is there any vendor where we constantly...", "What patterns..."
**Approach**:
- **THIS IS WHERE INFERENCE IS CRITICAL**
- Look for patterns across multiple transactions/entities
- "Constantly" or "consistently" means: appears in multiple transactions (2+)
- "Discrepancies" means: varying amounts, inconsistent data, unusual patterns
- "Issues" means: detect problems from data patterns, not explicit error flags

**Example Question**: "Is there any vendor where we constantly have payment discrepancies?"
**Good Answer**: "Yes - Vendor 1 (ID 1). There are at least two transactions with differing amounts (1394.88 on 2025-02-03 and 1364.88 on 2025-01-22), while other vendors have only single transactions in the data."
**Bad Answer**: "The graph does not contain any information about payment discrepancies." ❌ WRONG - discrepancies can be inferred from varying amounts!

**Example Question**: "Which vendors consistently give us discounts?"
**Good Answer**: "Vendor 1 (ID 1) - multiple transactions (TX-V15-M01-588603 and TX-V15-M01-654498) include discounts. (Other vendors show discounts only in single transactions.)"
**Bad Answer**: "The graph doesn't track discount consistency." ❌ WRONG - consistency can be inferred from multiple transaction records!

## Inputs

### Question
Natural language questions about:
- Transaction verification and payment status
- Product purchases (laptops, monitors, storage devices, RAM, keyboards, SSDs, HDDs, etc.)
- Vendor relationships and spending patterns
- Invoice details, discounts, payment timing
- Order quantities and equipment auditing
- Pattern detection (discrepancies, consistency, trends)

### Context (Knowledge Graph)

**Structure**: Text-based graph with two components:

**Nodes** (Entities with IDs and content):
- **Transactions** (tx-*): Purchase records - `Transaction recorded on 2025-03-04; total 3723.76; discount 460.24`
- **Vendors** (vendor *): Vendor entities - `Vendor id 2`, `Vendor with ID 3`
- **Line Items** (lineitem *): Product details - `Line item for SKU PTD-LAP-003 (qty 7, unit price 2199.0, line total 15393.0)`
- **Invoices** (inv-*): Invoice records - `Invoice dated 2025-03-22, due 2025-04-21, total 3723.76`
- **Quantities** (quantity *): Numeric values - `Quantity node representing 7 units`
- **Dates** (date *): Calendar dates - `date 2025-03-25`
- **Products**: Descriptions - `Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon`, `LG 27" UltraWide Monitor`
- **Aggregate nodes**: JSON-like structured data with full transaction details

**Relationships** (Typed edges):
- `paid_to`: transaction → vendor (who received payment)
- `contains_item`: transaction/invoice → line item (products in order)
- `has_quantity`: line item → quantity (how many units)
- `due_on`: invoice → date (payment due date)
- `is_a`: entity → type (taxonomy)
- `made_from`: derived node → source data (provenance)

**Graph Characteristics**:
- Size: 10-40 nodes per context
- Interconnected with multiple relationship types
- **May contain incomplete information** - missing payment status, missing invoices, partial data
- Mix of structured (amounts, dates, IDs) and semi-structured (text descriptions) content

## Outputs

### Content Requirements

✓ **Answer the question directly** - don't just describe what's in the graph
✓ **Include specific identifiers**: Transaction IDs (TX-V2-M02-176206), vendor IDs, dates (2025-03-04), amounts ($3,723.76), SKUs (DHP-MON-002), quantities
✓ **Infer patterns when needed** - for questions about "consistently", "constantly", "discrepancies", "issues" - analyze multiple data points
✓ **State data gaps explicitly** - "I can't confirm payment status - the graph shows the transaction but no payment record"
✓ **Provide context for numbers** - "Vendor 4: $17,161.20" not just "$17,161.20"
✓ **Distinguish absence vs. negative** - "No X found" is different from "Cannot determine X"

✗ **DON'T say "graph contains no information about X"** if X can be inferred from patterns
✗ **DON'T require explicit flags** - discrepancies/issues are inferred, not labeled
✗ **DON'T just describe the graph** - answer the actual question
✗ **DON'T be overly verbose** - be concise but complete

### Style Requirements

- **Brief and precise**: 1-3 sentences for simple lookups, 3-5 sentences for complex analysis
- **Factual tone**: State what you found, inferred, or cannot determine
- **Use specific IDs and values**: Always cite transaction IDs, dates, amounts when relevant
- **Handle uncertainty properly**: "I can't confirm X because Y is missing" NOT "The graph doesn't contain X"

### Answer Quality Examples

**HIGH QUALITY** (would score 1.0 on LLM-as-a-judge):
- "Yes - Vendor 1 (ID 1). There are at least two transactions with differing amounts (1394.88 on 2025-02-03 and 1364.88 on 2025-01-22), while other vendors have only single transactions in the data."
- "We spend more with Vendor 4 - $17,161.20 (Vendor 4) vs $3,723.76 (Vendor 2)."
- "Yes. Vendor 2 sold 3× LG 27" UltraWide Monitors (SKU DHP-MON-002) - they were UltraWide, not standard screens."

**LOW QUALITY** (would score 0.0 on LLM-as-a-judge):
- "The graph does not contain information about payment discrepancies." ❌ Should infer from transaction patterns
- "There are transactions in the graph." ❌ Too vague, doesn't answer the question
- "Both vendors exist." ❌ Doesn't provide the comparison requested
- "I need more data." ❌ Should state what's available and what specific data is missing</task_description>
